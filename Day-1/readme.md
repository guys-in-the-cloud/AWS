# AWS-Learnings Day-1

## Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of the compute power, database, storage, application and IT services through a cloud service platform over internet pay-as-you-go (pay as users need them monthly/ quarterly /annually).

## Five Chracteristics of Cloud Computing

1. **On-Demand Self Service** :- Cloud is a global service where users can access any cloud service any region of the world.
2. **Borad-Network-Access** :- Users can access cloud services from any broad network or network providers.
3. **Scalability** :- Users can increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet changing demand.
4. **Resource-pooling** :- Resources can be(storage,network,virtual machines) i.e. used by cloud users. Resource pooling means user can pull these resources as they needed(pay-as-you-go)
5. **Measured-Services** :- Monitors how much of a particular service each customer consumes within a designated time period.

## Services In Cloud

The services in Cloud Computing are as follows :-

1. **IAAS** (Infrastructure as a Service) -
   The user is able to manage data ,OS, runtimes,middleware and application and providers are provided with infrastructure services like, network ,servers, 
   virtualization and  storage as you need them via cloud through internet ,pay-as-you-go.
   Eg. AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP.
   
2. **PAAS** (Product as a Service) -
   PaaS allows the user to develop, run, and manage their own apps without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform usually associated with the 
   process. 
   Eg. AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Apache Stratos, Google App Engine.

3. **SAAS** (Software as a Service) -
   Software-as-a-service (SaaS), also known as cloud application services, is the most comprehensive form of cloud computing services, delivering an entire 
   application that is managed by a provider, via a web browser.
   Eg. Gmail, Drive, Dropbox, Hubspot.

## Deployment In Cloud

1. **Public-Cloud** :-  Public cloud are AWS, Azure, GCP.
2. **Private Cloud** :- Organization/company has their own private cloud.
3. **Hybrid Cloud** :- It is combination of public and private cloud.
4. **Multi Cloud** :-  Users can use multiple public clouds  Eg. (AWS+GCP)

## Regions & Zones

AWS (Amazon Web Services) regions and zones are infrastructure components of the AWS global infrastructure.

1. **AWS Regions** : AWS is divided into multiple regions around the world. Each region represents a separate geographic area and is composed of multiple Availability Zones. Each region is identified by a unique code, such as "us-east-1" for the US East (N. Virginia).

2. **Availability Zones** : Within each AWS region, there are multiple Availability Zones (AZs). Availability Zones are isolated data centers within a region that are physically separate from each other. The primary purpose of Availability Zones is to provide fault tolerance and resilience.
